- <b> AlgoOpt (Full Stack Web App, utilizing: React, NodeJS, Python, Flask)</b>
   <p> I am currently working on a cloud based web application for optimizing stock trading algorithms, that we have been calling 'AlgoOpt'. Unfortunately I can't share it on here but some technologies and libraries used include: JavaScript, React, Flask, Yfinance,     Backtesting.py, and SQL. This is probably my favorite project I have worked on so far. I cant share any of the code from it but can show a few screenshots of the program. I was primarily responsible for the front end and UI, and am quite pleased with it.    </p>
